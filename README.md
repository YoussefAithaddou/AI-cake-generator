## Features

- **Brand Input:** Users can input the name of their favorite brand, setting the creative direction for their brand-inspired cake.

- **AI-Generated Descriptions:** The application uses Chat GPT API to generate enticing descriptions of the cakes, capturing the essence of the chosen brands.

- **Visual Masterpieces:** Stable Diffusion transforms the generated descriptions into ultra-realistic 4K images, adorned with the brand's colors, design, and logo.

- **Streamlit Interface:** The results are displayed using Streamlit, providing users with an engaging and interactive experience.

- **Customizable and Shareable:** Users can share their brand-inspired cakes with friends, offering a unique blend of fashion and flavor.

## How it Works
